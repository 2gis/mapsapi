## DG.Entrance

Displays the entrance to the building. The class supports simple animation and display of multiple entrances.
Entrance objects are arrows that change their scale, together with the change in scale of the map, but not below
16 level, after which the arrows disappear from the map (until an acceptable zoom level is restored).
